# System and Application Configuration files, a.k.a. dotfiles

This is a collection of configuration files, a.k.a. dotfiles. The repository is named "dotfiles" since UNIX-like systems, configuration files start with a dot, `.`, to make them hidden in the user's `$HOME` directory. The convention for GitHub users that want to manage and organize their configuration files is to create a "dotfiles" repository, so this repository has been similarly named to follow the convention. However, this repository also contains system and application configuration files for Windows machines as well. The leading dot, `.`, has also been removed from the files to make the files visible within a terminal or file manager. The leading dot, `.`, should be added when copied to a new machine as needed.
